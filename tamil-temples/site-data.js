Raja Raja Chola I dedicated this temple to Lord Shiva, naming the deity Rajarajeswarar. The temple complex originally had elaborate murals depicting Shaiva legends and scenes from the life of Raja Raja Chola.

When she met Lord Shiva on Mount Kailash, her third breast disappeared, fulfilling the prophecy that she would marry the man before whom this happened. Lord Shiva came to Madurai as Sundareswarar and married Meenakshi (Thadaathagai). The temple complex covers 14 acres with 14 gopurams, the tallest being the southern tower at 170 feet.

According to Puranic legend, Chandra married the 27 daughters of Daksha (representing the 27 nakshatras). However, he showed excessive affection towards Rohini, neglecting the others. Angered, Daksha cursed Chandra to lose his brilliance. Chandra came to this sacred spot and worshipped Lord Shiva. Pleased by his devotion, Shiva placed Chandra on his head (hence Chandrasekhar) and granted that the moon would wax and wane in a monthly cycle rather than losing his light entirely. Devotees visit this temple to mitigate the adverse effects of a weak Moon in their horoscope.' }

According to legend, Goddess Parvati once playfully covered Lord Shiva\'s eyes, plunging the world into darkness. As penance, she came to Kanchipuram and made a Shiva Lingam out of sand (earth) under a mango tree on the banks of the Vegavathi river. Lord Shiva tested her devotion by sending fire and flood, but Parvati held the lingam tightly, leaving her embrace marks on it. The Prithvi Lingam here still bears these marks.

The legend tells of a spider (Sri) and an elephant (Yanai) who were both devotees of Shiva. The spider wove webs over the lingam as a canopy to protect it from falling leaves, while the elephant poured water to clean it, destroying the webs. This conflict led to their repeated battles across multiple births. The Shiva Lingam here is always partially submerged in water from an underground spring that has never dried up, representing the water element. The presiding Goddess, Akilandeswari, is one of the most powerful forms of the Goddess, and her fierce power was tamed by Adi Shankaracharya who installed Sri Chakra earrings on her.' }
