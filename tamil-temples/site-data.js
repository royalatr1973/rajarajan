The vimana (tower) rises to 216 feet and is topped by an 80-ton single granite capstone. Legend says the stone was moved to the top using a 6-km long ramp. The temple was the first in the world to be built entirely of granite. The Nandi (bull) at the entrance, carved from a single rock, weighs 25 tons. Raja Raja Chola I dedicated this temple to Lord Shiva, naming the deity Rajarajeswarar. The temple complex originally had elaborate murals depicting Shaiva legends and scenes from the life of Raja Raja Chola. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 as part of the Great Living Chola Temples.' },

Instead, a three-year-old girl with three breasts emerged from the holy fire. A divine voice told the king to name her Thadaathagai and raise her as a prince. When she met Lord Shiva on Mount Kailash, her third breast disappeared, fulfilling the prophecy that she would marry the man before whom this happened. Lord Shiva came to Madurai as Sundareswarar and married Meenakshi (Thadaathagai). The temple complex covers 14 acres with 14 gopurams, the tallest being the southern tower at 170 feet. The temple has 33,000 sculptures and the famous Golden Lotus Tank (Potramarai Kulam).' },

Hanuman arrived with the Kailash lingam, and Rama installed both - the sand lingam (Ramalingam) as the main deity and the Kailash lingam (Vishwalingam) nearby. The temple has the longest corridor of any Hindu temple in India, stretching 1,220 meters. There are 22 sacred wells (theerthams) within the temple, each believed to have curative properties.' }

Lord Shiva tested her devotion by sending fire and flood, but Parvati held the lingam tightly, leaving her embrace marks on it. The Prithvi Lingam here still bears these marks.

The spider wove webs over the lingam as a canopy to protect it from falling leaves, while the elephant poured water to clean it, destroying the webs. This conflict led to their repeated battles across multiple births. The Shiva Lingam here is always partially submerged in water from an underground spring that has never dried up, representing the water element. The presiding Goddess, Akilandeswari, is one of the most powerful forms of the Goddess, and her fierce power was tamed by Adi Shankaracharya who installed Sri Chakra earrings on her.' }
