            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              With a foundation in Computer Science Engineering from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering,
              I have developed analytical capabilities through technical training while gaining exposure to
              business problems through entrepreneurial initiatives and industry internships.
            </p>

            <h3>Motivation for Management Education</h3>
            <p>
              My experiences leading a college venture, building a legal-technology product, and analyzing
              market dynamics at Ashok Leyland have clarified the need for structured management training.
              A Master in Management programme will address gaps in strategic thinking, cross-functional
              management, and international business exposure.
            </p>

            <h3>Career Direction</h3>
            <p>
              I am oriented toward roles in Product Management, Business Analytics, Strategy, or General
              Management. My focus is on building operational competence across functions rather than
              specializing early in consulting.
